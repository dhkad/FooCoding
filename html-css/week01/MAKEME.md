    - Your personal info
    - A picture
    - A few lines about who you are

  - Include the following:
    - Different types of headings (`<h1>`, `<h2>`)
    - A list (`<ul>`). In this list include the _learning strategies_ you used making your resume. Also include some of the resources/references, this can be documentation/video etc, that where helpful.

### How to hand in Homework:

_Steps_:

1. In your newly created Github account search for the invitation from the HackYourFuture organization to you join your classes team.
2. Create a new repository (name it something like hyf-html-css) make sure you select the option: initialize with README.
3. Inside your new repository create a folder called "week1". If you have trouble finding out how to create a folder in Github check this [Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18773598/creating-folders-inside-github-com-repo-without-using-git)

   > Tip: you can also create a "week1" folder on your local computer that contains you files and upload the entire folder to Github.

4. Upload the files you created on your computer (step 3 of the homework) inside this folder, write a description for this “commit” (for example: "homework week1").
5. Your hyf-html-css/week1 should now contain an index.html and a main.css file (and maybe a folder containing your images)
6. Open the files in your folder to check if all of this worked.
7. Now go to the settings of your repository:![settings overview](./assets/github_pages1.png)
8. And go to _Github Pages_ select "master" instead of "none"![pages overview](./assets/github_pages2.png)
9. Now you can view your homework online at: https://_hereyouplaceyourgithubusername_.github.io/hyf-html-css/week1
10. Please upload a link to your homework in Trello.

### Here is an example of how your homework repository should look:
